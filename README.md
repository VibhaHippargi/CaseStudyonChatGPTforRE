This repo consists of case studies performed on ChatGPT 4o for requirements traceability maintainence tasks.

Green, Yellow, Red colors in the excel sheets show High/Medium/Low ratings. They are helpful to interpret the participant's feedback better.

SYSRS - SWRS pooling evaluation: includes responses from five participants, with each participant's response displayed in a uniquely colored column.
SYSRS - SWRS Ranking Evaluation: The shuffled responses are labeled 'A to F.' In the given ranking (e.g., 'AFEBCD'), if response 'E' was ChatGPT's response, it was highlighted in red after receiving the expert evaluator's feedback. So all the highlighted labels were chatGPT's response.
